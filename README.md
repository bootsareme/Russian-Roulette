# Russian Roulette
Russian Roulette is a popular game in which players take turns shooting themselves with a revolver. The revolver has 6 chambers and only one is loaded. Likewise, this Windows-based game recreates Russian Roulette except your PC is on the line.

## DANGER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THIS PROGRAM. IT WILL BREAK YOUR PC IF YOU PLAY. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!

# How do I play?
If you ignored the warning above and still want to play, download the x64 release executable and run it. If you run it normally, your PC will only crash; IF YOU RUN IT IN ADMIN MODE, YOUR MBR WILL BE OVERWRITTEN. Admittedly, real Russian Roulette is played by running the .exe as admin.
